This is Budget Excel, a cheap table editor with formular support.

It supports basic mathematical operations (+, -, *, /, %, !), but you can also reference other table cells (e.g., A1 + B1) and do a few named functions, such as pow(-2, 3) or gcd(3, 5) (for power calculation and calculating the greatest common divisor respectively)

For formular support, I've written a recusive descent parser.
Here is the grammar:

program -> expr

expr -> term { ('+' | '-') term } \[ '!' ]

term -> factor { ('*' | '/' | '%') factor }

factor -> NUMBER
| '(' expr ')'
| ENTRY
| '-' factor
| func

func -> ('pow' | 'gcd') '(' expr ',' expr ')'

NUMBER -> Digit { Digit } \[ '.' Digit { Digit } ]
ENTRY -> Letter { Letter } Digit { Digit }

Here is how the formular support works:
1) select any cell
2) write '=', so the program knows you want to write a formular
3) write your expression, e.g. pow(A1, 2) * 32.4 + 3
